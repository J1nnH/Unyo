## About Unyo

**Unyo** is a desktop application (inspired from [Dantotsu](https://github.com/rebelonion/dantotsu)) where you can watch and read your favourite animes and mangas, it is fully integrated with anilist so whatever content you consume will always be synced automatically. It has great UI and animations, and above all Add-Free.

## Installation

You can download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/K3vinb5/Unyo/releases/latest) tab.

If you are on **Windows**, you can:
- Download the .zip, extract it and run the executable "unyo.exe"

If you are on **Linux**, you can:
- Download the .zip, extract it and run the executable "unyo"
- Downlaod the .AppImage, and run it (Recommended option)
- Download the .deb, and install the package by running "sudo apt install ./package_name.deb" (Debian based distros only)

## Available Sources

The sources for this app are from a custom made api that uses [Aniyomi](https://github.com/aniyomiorg/aniyomi) extensions, this means that if you wish to have a source added you can open a issue saying the name of the extension and I'll try to integrate it. Note that because the orinal project was for android I had to translate a lot of the codebase to work on pc, this means that not all extensions will be working (most likely a skill issue to be honest -_-)

## Known Issues

- Some videos streams don't work, and the app won't give you an error, a bit rare to happen on working extensions.
- Some banners will cause the app to have weird issues, since coloring is based on the banner, if you experience that, go to versin 0.4.8 or 0.4.9
